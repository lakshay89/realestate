            In real estate, location is paramount. Indirapuram is Ghaziabad's most desirable location, majorly preferred by government employees, bank staff, bureaucrats, and IT professionals working in Central Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Sector 62, Noida. Living in <strong>The Horizon Residences – Indirapruam Ghaziabad</strong>, Indirapuram, means easy access to major highways (NH 24 – 5 mins drive) and metro lines (Sector 62 and Vaishali metro station – 10 mins drive), making commutes a breeze. Residents can also have easy access to facilities such as malls (North India Mall), hospitals (Max Super Speciality Hospital, Yashoda Hospital), top-tier educational institutes (DPS Indirapuram, Cambridge School), etc., located in proximity. Additionally, the project is located directly opposite the Indirapuram Habitat Center and near good residential townships, which could positively impact resale and rental demand.
